# Tactics Ogre Reborn Level Sync Patch
A basic patcher for Tactics Ogre Reborn which removes the level sync.
## How to install
For this patch to work, you will need to have unpacked your "Tactics Ogre Reborn.exe" using Steamless. Make sure the unpacked file has been renamed to "Tactics Ogre Reborn.exe".

1) Copy the contents of this directory into X\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Tactics Ogre Reborn.
2) Make a copy of your Tactics Ogre Reborn file and put in a safe place. You may wish to keep the old .exe file. 
3) Run "Tactics Ogre Reborn Sync Patch.exe". Make sure it is in the same directory as your "Tactics Ogre Reborn.exe".
4) Enjoy!
